        All YANG based entity classes that have lists in them use YList
        to represent the list.

        The "list" statement is used to define an interior data node in the
        schema tree.  A list node may exist in multiple instances in the data
        tree.  Each such instance is known as a list entry.  The "list"
        statement takes one argument, which is an identifier, followed by a
        block of substatements that holds detailed list information.

        A list entry is uniquely identified by the values of the list's keys,
        if defined.
